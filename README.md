# TuLabSound
This is an audio gem for O3DE that will have some advanced features like:
 - Audio Graph Editor
 - Mixing
 - And other stuff.

This uses [LabSound](https://github.com/LabSound/LabSound) under the hood, please check out their project too.

### Work in progress
Currently, this is a work in progress; my time is divided between other gems I'm developing for my game.
